This repository holds a game "Ocean Runner" that is a 2D platforming game. There are two 
scenes in the game: the "InGame" scene and the "MainMenu" scene. 

After the player runs the game, the main menu is displayed. The main menu provides two 
options: start and quit. If the "start" button is pressed then the player is directed to
the game, and if the "quit" button is pressed then the player quits the application.

In the game the player starts as a crab avatar that is running across the ground. The goal 
of the player is to avoid obstacles and increase one's score overtime. To dodge obstacles 
the player can press the "space" bar to jump over them. If the player runs into an obstacle
then they will die. Once the player dies the main menu screen is displayed again and the player
can choose to either play again by pressing "start" or quit the game by pressing "quit".

There are no game breaking bugs in this application and the game should be able to run as expected.
